= Mule Object Stores
:keywords: esb, object store, objects, persist

An *object store* is a facility for storing objects in Mule. Mule uses object stores whenever it needs data to persist for later retrieval. Internally, Mule uses object stores in various filters, routers, and other message processors that need to store state between messages. In most cases, Mule creates and manages object stores automatically, so no user configuration is necessary.

[NOTE]
====
To use the link:mule-user-guide/v/3.8/object-store-module-reference[object Store module] in Anypoint Studio, you must first download the *Object Store Connector* from the link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/anypoint-exchange[Anypoint Exchange]. +

== Use Cases

In most cases, Mule creates and manages object stores for you, so no configuration is necessary. However, you may explicitly configure an object store in the following cases:

* When configuring an link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/idempotent-filter[idempotent message filter] or until a successful scope occurs.
* When configuring the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/endpoint-configuration-reference#redelivery-policy[*Idempotent Redelivery Policy*] of a custom endpoint.

* When configuring an link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/splitter-flow-control-reference#aggregator-configuration[Aggregator], you can either use the two default built-in object stores or createa and reference your own.

* When configuring a custom component that must use an object store to persist information.
* When storing or retrieving information from a Mule flow through the Object Store module, link:http://mulesoft.github.io/objectstore-connector/1.3.3/apidocs/mule/objectstore-config.html[available as an extension].

Mule provides two types of object stores:

* *In-memory store* – Persistent store is the default. For more information, see "Object Stores and Clustering" in the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/cache-scope[Cache Scope] document.

* *Persistent store* – Mule persists data when an object store is explicitly configured to be persistent. Mule creates a default persistent store in the file system.

[TIP]
The default object store created for all new caching strategies supports cluster mode out of the box, with the exception of the cache scope which uses the old default caching strategy. For details, see the Object Stores and Clustering section in link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/cache-scope[Cache Scope].

== Adding Object Store Components

. Click the *X* icon in the Anypoint Studio taskbar to open Anypoint Exchange.
. Search for `Object Store` and click *Install*.
+

+
This starts an installation Wizard.
+
. Search for the *Object Store Connector* and click *Install*.
. Click *Next*, then *Next* again. Accept the terms of the license agreement and click *Finish*.
. After installing the Object Store Connector into Studio, the connector is available in the Mule Palette by searching for `ObjectStore`.
. Drag the connector into your flow in the canvas. For example:
+

+
. Click the connector to access its properties editor.
+

+
. Click the green plus sign image:add.png[plus] to configure global settings for: +
Partition, Object Store Reference (to the object store bean), Entry time-to-live in milliseconds, Expiration interval, Maximum number of entries, and whether the storage is persistent. For more information, click in a field, and click the blue info icon:
+
image:info-icon.png[info-icon]
+
. Select one of the available operations from the drop-down menu:
+
[cols="30a,70a",options="header"]
|===
| *All keys* |
Returns a list of all the keys in the object store.
| *Contains* |
Checks whether the object store contains the given key.
| *Dual store* |
Stores a value using key, and also store key using value.
| *Remove* |
Remove the object for the respective key.
| *Retrieve* |
Retrieve an object from the object store and make it available in the specified property scope of a Mule Message.
| *Retrieve store* |
Retrieve and Store in the same operation.
| *Retrieve with lock* |
Retrieve the given object with lock from the object store and make it available in the specified property scope of a Mule Message.
| *Store* |
Stores an object in the object store.
|===

. Depending on the operation you select, different fields are available to configure the connector.

== XML Example

The following example demonstrates how to configure object stores in the following three situations:

. link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/idempotent-filter[idempotent filter] with an in-memory object store.
. idempotent filter with a persistent object store.
. Until a successful scope occurs with an in-memory object store.
