= Custom Metadata Tab
:keywords: anypoint, studio, metadata, meta data, data format, data structure, dataweave, payload contents

== Overview


The custom metadata tab is included in all message processors except connectors (which already contribute their own metadata to DataSense). The custom metadata tab allows you to define metadata types for message processors that do not automatically contribute their own types.

This metadata is handled by link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/datasense[DataSense] and exposed in design time on every component of your flows, helping you debug your application and know if the expected data structure differs from what's truly being sent. It's specially useful when using the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/dataweave[DataWeave] transformer.

[NOTE]
====
When using the DataWeave transformer, you must define the input and output types by either defining these in other components of your flow through the metadata tab (as explained in this document), or by defining this metadata link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/using-dataweave-in-studio#defining-input-and-output-structure[through the Transform Message component] itself.
====



The image below shows the *Metadata* tab on the properties editor of the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/file-endpoint-reference[File endpoint].

Clicking *Add Metadata* (outlined in the image above) opens a new set of fields, shown below.

image:custommetadata2.png[custommetadata2]

Clicking the dropdown menus allows you to select between the available metadata types.

The defined metadata types are automatically recognized as inputs by the next message processor in the flow.

You can define the following types of input and output metadata:

* FlowVars
* SessionVars
* Message Inbound Properties
* Message Outbound Properties
* Message Payload

NOTE: When editing metadata on an inbound endpoint, only outbound metadata is available.


== Adding Multiple Metadata Types

To define more than one metadata type, click *Add metadata* in the metadata editor, one time for each metadata type you need to define. To remove a metadata type, click the *Remove* image:rem_icon.png[image] icon next to the right of the editor.

== Defining a Metadata Type

When clicking on the *Add Metadata* button, a window will open where you can either select an already defined type, or define a new one.

To define a new type;

. Click the green plus sign at the top.
+
image::custom-metadata-tab-c9f9e.png[]

. Give the new type a _name_
. Select a data format (eg: XML, JSON, CSV, etc)

+
image::custom-metadata-tab-0e99d.png[]

. Depending on the selected option, there are different ways to define the data structure. With some formats, the structure can be inferred from an example, others require a schema, for some of these a builtin editor UI can be used to define this schema easily.


[cols="40a,20a,20a,20a",options="header"]
|===
|Format |Sample | Schema | Editor
|JSON |X |X |
|XML |X |X |
|Java |X | |
|Map | | |X
|CSV |X | |X
|Fixed Width |X | |X
|Copybook |X |X |
|Flat File | |X |
|Simple | | |X
|===

[TIP]
See reference docs for the schema structures required for link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/dataweave-flat-file-schemas[Flat-File] and link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/dataweave-edi-schemas[EDI].

[NOTE]
====
* When defining the structure through the editor, you're implicitly creating a schema for that type. These schemas are stored in your project's `src/main/resources` folder, and you can open these and edit them freely on Anypoint Studio.

* Copybook type definitions actually use flat-file schemas, Migration from copybook to fixedwidth is supported with the exception of some options, link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/dataweave-flat-file-schemas[see which ones].

* On Fixed Width, the field property 'numbersign' is not configurable via the UI and the default is always used, however you can edit the schema directly if you wish to assign it a different value.
====


On the fixed width editor, you can configure several properties of each of your fields through the *format* column of each. Click on the button to open a menu where you can select not only the type of the field, but also its alignment, decimals, if extra characters are to be filled with zeros or empty spaces, etc.

After you create a new type, you can associate any new metadata you create with this new type to avoid having to define it again.

== Simple Example

In this example, the application's flow takes an XML file as input, and passes it to a DataWeave transformer. The DataWeave transformer automatically inherits the input fields from the File endpoint, even if no file has yet been received.

This example uses the XML file displayed below. To complete the example, copy and save the code below into an XML file on your hard drive, or download it link:_attachments/datasense-xml-sample.xml[here]. You'll need to supply it to the metadata editor.

    <employee>
        <firstname>Annie</firstname>
        <lastname>Point</lastname>
    <gender>F</gender>
    <phone>1234-12345</phone>
    </employee>
    <manager>

        <lastname>Mule</lastname>
    <gender>M</gender>

    </manager>
</staff>
----

. Create a new Mule project
. Place a File endpoint as the inbound endpoint in the flow, configure it so that its 'path' points to a folder in your hard drive
. Click the *Metadata* tab, then click the *Add Metadata* button. Studio displays the metadata editor, shown below.

image::custom-metadata-tab-0e99d.png[]

The field *Output: Payload* is automatically selected from the drop-down menu. Click the edit icon image:edit_icon.png[image] to edit the field. Studio displays the *Define Type* window, shown below.

image:define_type_window.png[define_type_window]

. Click the green plus sign at the top.
+
image::custom-metadata-tab-c9f9e.png[]

. Give the new type a _name_ . In this case, we use `myXML`.
. Click the dropdown menu next to *Type* and select a data format: XML
. Click the drop-down menu that displays *Schema,* then select *Example*.

+
image::custom-metadata-tab-1fb01.png[]

. Click the ellipsis (*...*) button to use the filesystem browser to navigate to, then select the example XML file (provided above).
. Once you have selected the file, click *Select*.

. Now, place a link:/mule-user-guide/3.8/dataweave[DataWeave transformer] in the flow after the File inbound endpoint. The input metadata fields for the DataWeave transformer are automatically defined, as shown below.

image::custom-metadata-tab-bf539.png[]

Message processors after the File endpoint inherit the defined metadata. In this example, as you added a metadata definition to the File endpoint's output, this metadata type is expected as an input by the DataWeaver transformer. After you define a transformation for this component to carry out, any other message processors that you place after it in the flow will expect the resulting structure from applying the transformation onto the metadata you defined in the endpoint.
