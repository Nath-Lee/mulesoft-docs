== Managing Regions

If Global Deployment is enabled on your account, you can also set the *Default Region*. The region auto-populates in the deployment screen settings for all applications deployed by users in your organization, and it can be adjusted at the application level if necessary for individual deployments. Access this menu by clicking the gear icon next to your user name at the top of the screen and then picking the *CloudHub* link, under SETTINGS in the left menu.
