== Getting API Access Information

After you get an app's client ID and client secret, you can run a *curl* command from a command line to get the bearer token, organization ID, and environment ID by using the Authorize resource. Once authorized, you can use the bearer token organization ID and environment ID in the rest of the calls.

To get API access information:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. Click *MQ*, *Client Apps*, and click the blue plus circle icon to create an app.
. Get the Client ID and Client Secret and plug these values into the *curl* command below replacing `myclientId` and `myclientSecret`:

----
curl -X POST -H "client_id: myclientId" -H "client_secret: myclientSecret" -H "grant_type: client_credentials" -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d 'client_id={{client_id_broker}}&client_secret={{client_secret_broker}}&grant_type=client_credentials' "https://mq-us-east-1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/api/v1/authorize"`
----
+
. Submit the *curl* command.

You can see the Organization ID and Environment ID from Anypoint Platform by clicking *Access Management* and examining the *Organization* and *Environments* sections.
