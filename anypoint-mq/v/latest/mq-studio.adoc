*Required:* No +
*Default:* None
|Basic Settings: +
Max Redelivery |Number of redeliveries
to try in case a message fails. -1 indicates that Anypoint MQ retry indefinitely.

*Required:* No +
*Default:* -1
|[[am]]Acknowledgement Mode |Defines how the Anypoint MQ messages are acknowledged when the message are removed from being inflight messages. Possible values are:

* AUTO (Default)- Messages are acknowledged or negatively acknowledged depending on whether or not exceptions occur. See link:/anypoint-mq/mq-ack-mode[Acknowledgement Mode] for more information.
* MANUAL - Messages are acknowledged using a custom ACK message processor.
* NONE - Messages are acknowledged and removed as soon as they are received.

*Required:* No +
*Default:* None
|Acknowledgement Timeout |When you take an Anypoint MQ message from a queue, the broker puts it in flight, and the message remains in that state until the ACK is performed (application reads the message and Anypoint MQ deletes it), or the Acknowledgement Timeout is reached. If ACK is performed, then the message is removed from the queue, if Acknowledgement Timeout is reached, the message returns to the queue.

*Required:* No +
*Default:* None
|Pooling Time |Maximum time in milliseconds to wait for the expected message or messages.

*Required:* No +
*Default:* 10000
|Threading Profile Settings: +
Define threading profile behavior: +
Use default worker threading profile |See link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/tuning-performance[Tuning Performance]. The threading profile options let you optimize connector performance for use with Anypoint MQ.

*Required:* No +
*Default:* None
|Use custom worker threading profile |See link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/tuning-performance[Tuning Performance].

*Required:* No +
*Default:* None
|Max Active Threads |The maximum number of threads to use. See link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/tuning-performance[Tuning Performance].

*Required:* No +
*Default:* None
|Max Idle Threads |The maximum number of idle or inactive threads that can be in the pool before they are destroyed. See link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/tuning-performance[Tuning Performance]. The thread pool does not grow from Max Idle Threads towards Max Active Threads unless the queue is completely filled up.

*Required:* No +
*Default:* None
|Thread TTL |Thread time to live duration.

*Required:* No +
*Default:* None
|Pool Exhausted Action |When the maximum pool size or queue size is bounded, this value determines how to handle incoming tasks. Possible values are: WAIT (wait until a thread becomes available; donâ€™t use this value if the minimum number of threads is zero, in which case a thread may never become available), DISCARD (throw away the current request and return), DISCARD_OLDEST (throw away the oldest request and return), ABORT (throw a RuntimeException), and RUN (the default; the thread making the execute request runs the task itself, which helps guard against lockup).

*Required:* No +
*Default:* None
|Thread Wait Timeout |Thread wait timeout in milliseconds.

*Required:* No +
*Default:* None
|Max Buffer Size |Max buffer size.

*Required:* No +
*Default:* None

=== TLS/SSL and Proxy Tabs

The TSL/SSL and Proxy tabs share the same information as the
link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/http-connector[HTTP Connector].

=== Prefetch Tab

Number of messages to receive at once when asking for messages. The response can contain fewer messages than this number depending on the `poolingTime` setting.

When you subscribe a flow to an Anypoint MQ queue, the flow pool regularly polls the queue looking for messages. This operation can be very time consuming. In order to avoid delays, prefetch was introduced. This is a component placed between the flow and the Anypoint MQ queue that polls the queue regularly, but without processing the pooled messages. You can change these values depending
on your site's performance and use case needs.

image:mq-prefetch-general.png[mq-prefetch-general]

The Prefetch tab fields are:

[width="100%",cols="20a,50a",options="header"]
|===
|Value |Description
|Fetch Size |Number of messages to prefetch.
|Fetch Timeout |Maximum duration in milliseconds to wait for the required amount of messages. When this time elapses, the response is sent with as many messages as taken during the period.
|Frequency |The duration in milliseconds to execute
the retrieve operation when the prefetch queue is not empty.
|===

*Note*: For best performance, set `Fetch Size` to 10 (maximum value) and reduce `Frequency` to increase the pooling time and the resulting dequeuing of transactions per second (TPS). You can increase `Fetch Timeout` if message processing is slow. For example, if processing takes 5 seconds, set the `Fetch Timeout` to at least double this time (10000 milliseconds).

Apart from these performance-related parameters, it is important to properly configure the xref:am[Acknowledgement Mode].

== Anypoint MQ Properties Menu

After configuring the Anypoint MQ connector's Global Element Properties, you need to configure the properties menu depending on how you want a flow to operate:

* <<Publish Operation>> - Send a message to a queue or exchange.
* <<Consume Operation>> - Receive a message from a queue.
* <<Ack Operation>> - Accept a message from a queue.
* <<Nack Operation>> - Do not accept a message from a queue. This causes the message to be returned to the queue.

=== Publish Operation
