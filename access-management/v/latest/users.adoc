= Users

== Assumptions

This page assumes that you have an Organization Administrator role in your organization, or that you have API Version Owner permissions and want to manage user permissions for your API version.

== Inviting Users

As an Organization Administrator, you can invite new users and manage existing users for your organization on the _Access Management_ Administration page, which you can reach by selecting the *Users* option in your *Access Management* section.

In order to invite new users to your organization:

. Click *Users* in the left navigation bar.
. Click *Invite user*.
. Enter the email addresses of who you want to invite in your organization as a comma-separated list.
. Optionally, select one or more link:/access-management/roles[roles] to which to assign these users.
. Click *Send Invitation*.

The users who you invite receive email invitations to sign up to your organization.

Resend or cancel a sent invitation? Click *Pending Invites* to view all invitations that have not yet been accepted. Select the ones you need to manage, and click *Re-send Invite* or *Cancel Invite*.

== Granting Permissions to Users

There are two ways to assign permissions to users:

* As an Organization Owner, or Organization Administrator, you can use the permissions system in the *Access Management* Administration page
::
. In the Organization Administration page, click *Users* to view a list of your users.
. Search or browse to find a user to whom you wish to grant permissions, then click the username.
. On the user details page, you can edit the user's email address, send a reset password link, or configure API Permissions and Roles. By default, the API Permissions tab is open.
. Click *Add an API resource by name...* to open a search field. Enter part or all of the name of the API to which you wish to grant permissions.

+
. Once you selected your desired API, configure versions and access levels by using the *Select Version* and *Select Access* buttons that are made visible. *Note* that you cannot grant Portal Viewer permissions unless the API has an API Portal.
. Your selections are commited automatically.

* The other method consists in assigning permissions from the permission system of each product within the Anypoint Platform.
:: For a detailed explanation on how to do this, check the documentation of the specific product. +
You can also check the link:/access-management/managing-accounts-roles-and-permissions[account roles and permissions] section for a list of all pre-set roles for each product.

== Role Mapping  - Map Users to Anypoint Platform Roles

You can set up your Anypoint Platform organization so that when a SAML user belongs to certain groups, Anypoint Platform automatically grants certain equivalent roles in your Anypoint Platform organization.

For a full description on how to do this, follow the instructions in our link:/access-management/external-identity#federated-organizations-map-users-to-anypoint-platform-roles[external identity] section.
