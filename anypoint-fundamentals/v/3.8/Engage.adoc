= Engage

Once your applications and APIs are designed, deployed and properly managed to guarantee their best performance, it is time for you to _engage_ to third party sources expanding your application network beyond your own resources.

This is where the *Engage* phase comes into play. Reach out to developers and make your content available to them as well.


== Exchange

link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/anypoint-exchange[Anypoint Exchange] lets you create organization-specific library-like sites called _private exchanges_ where you can share templates, connectors, examples, RAMLs, and WSDLs throughout your organization. You can also find MuleSoft-provided items in the link:https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange#!/[Exchange] site. Whether private or public, Exchange lets you create pages for each item with explanation text, videos of how to use the item, and links to documentation.

== Portals
After deploying an API, use API Portals to publicize the API and attract a user community. Create a multi-page portal for users to consume your public APIs and find assets, such as examples and policies, and set up users to access your private APIs. From the portal editing environment, include an API Notebook to convey technical workflows, for example, how to make an authenticated call to your RAML-based API. Include images, attachments, and an API Console for simulating calls to your RAML-based API. Engage the community through interaction with the API to solicit feedback and contributions.Â 

== API Notebook

The best way to present your API to users is through link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/walkthrough-notebook[API Notebook]: A web-based, persistent, JavaScript scripting workspace able to generate an API client from a RAML API definition.
This allows your users to explore and test examples for the resources in your API, executing authenticated live calls to an API on a real server or on an empty API interface.

You can make the API Notebook available to everyone and even save it as a gist in your GitHub account, making it versionable, forkable, shareable, and embeddable anywhere as markdown text.
