The Anypoint Platform offers you a rich toolset that enables you to deploy, manage, and operate your integration applications [designed and developed] with the Mule Runtime. It enables you to cover use cases that involve the cloud, servers fully on-premises or hybrid scenarios. It also offers tools to manage and monitor legacy APIs – that might be built with any other technology – via the use of autogenerated proxies.



== Deploy

Once you have link:/anypoint-fundamentals/v/3.8/design-and-develop[Designed and Developed] your integration applications with Mule Runtime, it’s time to deploy them to a production environment.

The Anypoint Platform offers different means to flexibly deploy your application to either a cloud environment, to a server or group of servers on premises that are managed via our online platform, or to a purely on-premises set up. Wherever it is that you deploy to, your application can be built using the same Mule Runtime.

The Anypoint Platform offers the following different options for deploying:

[TIP]
Anypoint Studio comes with an link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/build-a-hello-world-application#deploying-the-project[embedded server] meant for testing and debugging without leaving the IDE. This is a very comfortable option while troubleshooting what you're developing, but note that it's not intended to be the final stage to expose your application as certain restrictions in uptime apply.


=== A Standalone Mule Server

image:on-prem-logo.png[mule-server]

Deploy to a link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/starting-and-stopping-mule-esb[Mule Standalone server] – available as an Enterprise or Community product.

The most direct way of launching and interacting with a Mule Runtime is via the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/starting-and-stopping-mule-esb[command line] on the very server you run it in.



=== A Mule Server through Runtime Manager

image:hybrid-logo.png[CloudHubLogo133high]

Deploy via the link:/runtime-manager/[Runtime Manager] to a Mule link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers[server], or to several servers arranged as a Server Group or a Cluster.

As a much more empowering alternative to deploying to your Mule Runtimes through the lcommand line, you can do this by means of the the link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-your-own-servers[Runtime Manager console]. The Runtime Manager enables you to optionally group your Mule servers into link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers#create-a-cluster[clusters] or link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers#create-a-server-group[server groups], in order to ensure higher stability for your deployments. Once deployed, it also allows you to monitor and <<Runtime Manager, manage>> your running applications and servers.

[NOTE]
For a server to be visible to the Runtime Manager, you must first link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers#add-a-server[register it].


=== CloudHub through Runtime Manager

image:cloud-logo.png[CloudHubLogo133high]

Deploy via the link:/runtime-manager/[Runtime Manager] to link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub[CloudHub], our integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS).

Virtual machines in the cloud are referred to as workers. When deploying your apps to the cloud you can select different amounts and sizes of workers to scale up their processing capacity. You can also select the link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-cloudhub#region[physical location] of your virtual machines.

////
something about autoscaling when it comes out
////

Applications can be deployed to different link:/anypoint-platform-administration/managing-cloudhub-environments[environments] (such as _production_ or _QA_) to keep in line with the workflow you follow.

[TIP]
You can also deploy applications you're developing in Anypoint Studio directly to CloudHub link:runtime-manager/deploying-to-cloudhub#from-anypoint-studio[without leaving the Studio IDE].

Additionally you can use the link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/anypoint-platform-cli[Anypoint Platform Command Line Interface] to manage your Cloudhub's infrastructure components such as:

* The private networks where your workers are hosted (link:/runtime-manager/virtual-private-cloud[VPC])
* The load balancing for such network
* Firewall mapping rules to manage custom domains
* Two way SSL authentication with the option of using your custom certificates


=== A Mule Server through MMC

image:mmc.png[mmc]

The *link:/mule-management-console/v/3.8[Mule Management Console]* is another tool that enables you to deploy and manage your Mule Runtimes running on local servers.

Through MMC you can also group your Mule servers into clusters or server groups, and so ensure higher stability for your deployments.

[NOTE]
MMC is in the process of being fully replaced by the Runtime Manager, and will eventually be deprecated. A migration tool exists for migrating your MMC deployments to Runtime Manager.

////
link to MMC migrator missing, but it will be out soon, before this content is published

== Manage and Monitor

Once your integration applications are deployed, you can configure several aspects about it. The available options for managing vary depending on the form in which your application is deployed.

You also have access to several tools that allow you to keep track of your application's performance and debug any issues that may arise, including link:/runtime-manager/alerts-on-runtime-manager[automatic alerts], interactive dashboards with data at server and at application level, and event link:/runtime-manager/viewing-log-data[logs].


=== Runtime Manager

image:runtime-manager-logo.png[CloudHubLogo133high]

The link:/runtime-manager/[Runtime Manager] offers multiple tools to link:/runtime-manager/managing-deployed-applications[Manage] and link:/runtime-manager/monitoring-applications[Monitor] your applications and – for those running on premises – the servers they run on. It's intended to be the single pane of glass on which you can view all activity relevant to your running Mule applications, regardless of if they're deployed on-premises or to the cloud.

Built on top of Mule, Runtime Manager allows you to integrate and orchestrate applications, data sources, and services across on-premise systems and the cloud.

The Runtime Manager exposes important information about your running applications and the servers they're deployed to in real time through:

* link:/runtime-manager/alerts-on-runtime-manger[E-mail *Alerts* triggered by customizable events]
* link:/runtime-manager/notifications-on-runtime-manager[in-platform Event *Notifications*]
* link:/runtime-manager/monitoring-dashboards[Monitoring *dashboards* that display performance metrics of both applications and servers]
* link:/runtime-manager/insight[Transaction-level detail through the *insights* page]
* link:/runtime-manager/logs[Event logs] for applications deployed to the cloud. Applications deployed on-premises can link:/runtime-manager/sending-data-from-arm-to-external-monitoring-software[send log information to third party software]

Additionally, if your application is deployed to the cloud, you can link:/runtime-manager/managing-cloudhub-applications[configure the following aspects of it] through the Runtime Manager:

* link:/runtime-manager/managing-application-data-with-object-stores[Object Stores]
* link:/runtime-manager/managing-queues[Queues]
* link:/runtime-manager/managing-schedules[Schedules]
* link:/runtime-manager/secure-application-properties[Secure Application Properties]
* link:/runtime-manager/virtual-private-cloud[Virtual Private Cloud]




[TIP]
To better understand how options differ between applications deployed to CloudHub and those deployed on-premises, see link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-and-mule[CloudHub and Mule].


=== API Manager

image:api-logo.png[AnypointAPI_manager]

link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis[Anypoint Platform for APIs]* is an API and service registry and governance platform. Built from the ground up to support cloud and hybrid use cases, the platform governs all of your service and API assets, whether they’re internal or external, behind the firewall or on the cloud, on a single platform. By placing a proxy in front of your application, you can apply traffic policies, view usage metrics and more.

You can either register a Mule application (wherever it is that you deploy it to) by imbuing  link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/api-auto-discovery[autodiscovery parameters] onto it, or you can take an existing legacy API (that could well be created with different technology) and automatically create a Mule proxy to govern and monitor it. In either case, this registers an API onto the API manager

Once an API is registered, you can easily apply governance policies to it via the web UI, such as throttling or API whitelisting. You can apply these by simply clicking an *Activate* button, and optionally providing some values for its parameters. You can also generate your own custom policies if you require something that isn't covered by the lengthy list of pre built policies.

With your API registered, the Anypoint Platform will start link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/analytics[tracking analytics] about API usage and performance.

At that point you're also enabled to create an API portal, where users of your API can browse interactive API documentation that's automatically generated from your API's RAML definition file. Users can also read any other content that you want to expose there.

The platform supports keeping multiple versions of a same API in parallel, each with its independent set of policies, analytics and portal.

==== Managing a non-Mule Application

As an alternative scenario, you may want to use the Anypoint Platform to manage an API that isn't developed using the MuleSoft software. In that case, you can use the <<API Manager>> to deploy an auto generated proxy. Through this proxy, the anypoint platform can apply policies and obtain analytics information.

// this sub section might be redundant, as it's sort of explained already

=== Access Management

image:settings-logo.png[access management]

As an administrator of your Organization using the *Access Management* tool, you can manage the access and clearance level of users to your organization, business groups and the rest of the Anypoint Platform.

Create custom roles for the Runtime Manager and grant them your custom permissions to leverage activities among teams that share the same access privileges and link:/access-management/external-identity[set up external identities] to manage users and clients using your organization's external federated identity system.


=== MMC

image:mmc.png[mmc]

MMC provides robust runtime management capabilities for on-premises deployments.

You can monitor stuff, get email alerts and all that
