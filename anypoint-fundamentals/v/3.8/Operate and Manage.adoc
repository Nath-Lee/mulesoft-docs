The Anypoint Platform offers you a rich set of tools used to deploy, manage, and operate your integration applications you design and develop to run on Mule runtime. The platform enables you to cover use cases for businesses that run on servers in the cloud, on-premises, or some hybridized version. You can manage and monitor legacy APIs – perhaps built using other technologies – and help manage API consumption with the use of auto-generated proxies.


== Deploy

Once you link:/anypoint-fundamentals/v/3.8/design-and-develop[Design and Develop] your integration applications for use with Mule runtime, you are ready to deploy them to a production environment.

The Anypoint Platform offers different means to flexibly deploy your application to either a cloud environment, to a server or group of servers on premises that are managed via our online platform, or to a purely on-premises set up. Your applications can be built for the same Mule runtime, no matter the target deployment environment.

The Anypoint Platform offers the following deployment options:

[TIP]
Anypoint Studio includes an link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/build-a-hello-world-application#deploying-the-project[embedded server] intended for convenient testing and debugging in the IDE. This option is a convenient means of troubleshooting your nascent application. Note that it is not intended to be a production server as certain restrictions on uptime apply.


=== Standalone Mule Server

image:on-prem-logo.png[mule-server]

Deploy to a link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/starting-and-stopping-mule-esb[standalone Mule server] – available as an _Enterprise_ or _Community_ product.

The most direct method to launch and interact with a Mule runtime instance is the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/starting-and-stopping-mule-esb[command line] of the server you run Mule on.



=== Runtime Manager to Mule Server

image:hybrid-logo.png[CloudHubLogo133high]

Deploy an application using the link:/runtime-manager/[Runtime Manager] to a Mule link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers[server], or to several servers arranged as a "server group" or "cluster".

The link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-your-own-servers[Runtime Manager console] is a more powerful alternative to the command line for deploying apps to your Mule runtime instances. The Runtime Manager enables grouping of Mule servers into link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers#create-a-cluster[clusters] or link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers#create-a-server-group[server groups], in order to ensure improved stability for your deployments. Once an app has been deployed, Runtime Manager also allows you to monitor and <<Runtime Manager, manage>> your running applications and servers.

[NOTE]
To make a server visible to the Runtime Manager, you must first link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers#add-a-server[register it].


=== Runtime Manager to CloudHub

image:cloud-logo.png[CloudHubLogo133high]

Deploy to link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub[CloudHub] via the link:/runtime-manager/[Runtime Manager], our integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS).

When deploying your apps to the cloud you can select different amounts and sizes of workers to scale up their processing capacity. You can also select the link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-cloudhub#region[physical location] of your virtual machines.

[NOTE]
Virtual machines in the cloud are referred to as workers.

////
something about autoscaling when it comes out
////

Applications can be deployed to different link:/anypoint-platform-administration/managing-cloudhub-environments[environments] (such as _production_ or _QA_) to keep in line with your workflow.

[TIP]
You can also deploy applications you have developed in Anypoint Studio directly to CloudHub link:runtime-manager/deploying-to-cloudhub#from-anypoint-studio[without leaving the Studio IDE].

Additionally, you can use the link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/anypoint-platform-cli[Anypoint Platform Command Line Interface] to manage your CloudHub's infrastructure components such as:

* private networks where your workers are hosted (link:/runtime-manager/virtual-private-cloud[VPC])
* load balancing for such a network
* Firewall mapping rules to manage custom domains
* Two-way SSL authentication with the option of using your own custom certificates


=== MMC to a Mule Server

image:mmc.png[mmc]

The link:/mule-management-console/v/3.8[Mule Management Console (MMC)] is another tool for deployment and management of Mule runtime instances running on local servers.

Using MMC you can group your Mule servers into clusters or server groups, ensuring greater stability for your deployments.

[NOTE]
MMC is pending full replacement by Runtime Manager, and hence will eventually be deprecated. There is a migration tool for migrating your MMC deployments to Runtime Manager.

== Manage and Monitor

Once your integration application is deployed, you can configure several of its aspects. The available management options vary depending on the form in which your application is deployed.

Several tools are at your disposal, enabling you to monitor your application's performance, and subsequently debug any issues that arise. These include link:/runtime-manager/alerts-on-runtime-manager[automatic alerts], interactive dashboards with data at the server and application level, and link:/runtime-manager/viewing-log-data[event logs].


=== Runtime Manager

image:runtime-manager-logo.png[CloudHubLogo133high]

link:/runtime-manager/[Runtime Manager] provides multiple tools to link:/runtime-manager/managing-deployed-applications[Manage] and link:/runtime-manager/monitoring-applications[Monitor] your applications and, in the case of apps running on-prem, the servers they run on. Runtime Manager is intended to be the single pane of glass on which you can view all activity relevant to your running Mule applications, regardless of deployment: cloud or on-prem.

Built on top of Mule, Runtime Manager allows you to integrate and orchestrate application activity, data sources, and services across on-prem systems and the cloud.

Runtime Manager exposes important information about your live applications and the servers they are deployed to in real time using:

* link:/runtime-manager/alerts-on-runtime-manger[E-mail alerts] triggered by customizable events
* link:/runtime-manager/notifications-on-runtime-manager[In-platform Event Notifications]
* link:/runtime-manager/monitoring-dashboards[Monitoring dashboards] that display performance metrics of both applications and servers
* Transaction-level detail through the link:/runtime-manager/insight[insights page]
* link:/runtime-manager/logs[Event logs] for applications deployed to the cloud.
* Applications deployed on-premises can link:/runtime-manager/sending-data-from-arm-to-external-monitoring-software[send log information to third party software]

Additionally, if your application is deployed to the cloud, you can link:/runtime-manager/managing-cloudhub-applications[manage many features of CloudHub deployment] using Runtime Manager:

* link:/runtime-manager/managing-application-data-with-object-stores[Object Stores]
* link:/runtime-manager/managing-queues[Queues]
* link:/runtime-manager/managing-schedules[Schedules]
* link:/runtime-manager/secure-application-properties[Secure Application Properties]
* link:/runtime-manager/virtual-private-cloud[Virtual Private Cloud]




[TIP]
To better understand how options differ between applications deployed to CloudHub and those deployed on-premises, see link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-and-mule[CloudHub and Mule].


=== API Manager

image:api-logo.png[AnypointAPI_manager]

link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis[API Manager], formerly known as *Anypoint Platform for APIs*, is an API and service registry and governance platform. Built from the ground up to support cloud and hybrid use cases, the platform governs all of your service and API assets, whether internal or external, behind a firewall or in the cloud, all via one platform. Place a proxy in front of your application to apply traffic policies, view usage metrics and more.

You can either register a Mule application by imbuing it with link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/api-auto-discovery[auto-discovery parameters], or taking an existing legacy API and triggering creation of a Mule proxy to govern and monitor the API. Either case results in registration of your API with your API Manager.

Once an API is registered, you can easily link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/applying-runtime-policies[*apply governance policies*] to it via the web UI, such as *throttling* or *API whitelisting*. Apply such policies after providing parameter values, and then simply by clicking the *Activate* button. You can also generate your own custom policies if you require something that isn't covered by the lengthy list of pre-built policies.

With your API registered, the Anypoint Platform will start link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/analytics[tracking analytics] about API usage and performance.

At that point you could create an link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/engaging-users-of-your-api[*API portal*], where users of your API can browse interactive API documentation that is automatically generated from your API's RAML definition file. You can expose other content from this API Portal as well.

[TIP]
The platform supports maintenance of multiple versions of an API, each with its independent set of policies, analytics and portal.

==== Managing a non-Mule Application

Alternatively, you may want to use the Anypoint Platform to manage an API that isn't developed using MuleSoft software. In that case, you can use the <<API Manager>> to deploy an auto-generated proxy. Through this proxy, the Anypoint Platform can apply policies and obtain analytics information.

// this sub section might be redundant, as it's sort of explained already

=== Access Management

image:settings-logo.png[access management]

As an administrator of your organization using the *Access Management* tool, you can manage user access and clearance level for your organization, its business groups, as well as access to the rest of its Anypoint Platform tools.
//wasn't totally clear on the above, esp access to AP Platform

Create custom roles for users of Runtime Manager and grant custom permissions to control activities among teams that otherwise share the same access privileges. link:/access-management/external-identity[Set up external identities] to manage users and clients using your organization's external federated identity system.


=== Mule Management Console (MMC)

image:mmc.png[mmc]

MMC provides robust runtime management capabilities for on-premises deployments, including monitoring features, email alerts, logs, etc.


[NOTE]
MMC is pending full replacement by Runtime Manager, and hence will eventually be deprecated. There is a migration tool for migrating your MMC deployments to Runtime Manager.
